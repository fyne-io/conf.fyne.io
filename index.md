## Fyne Conf 2024

Fyne Conf 2024 was be our biggest ever event - held in Berlin, Germany and streamed online.

The event took place on 20th September 2024 at the [Axica congress centre](https://www.axica.de/), in central Berlin.

This event was a chance to learn more about Fyne and how it can be used to
easily build robust and performant cross platform applications.
We showcased useful techniques, best practices, new features and existing applications from around the community.
Novice to expert - coder, tester or designer - there was something for everyone.
