## Fyne Conf 2022

Fyne Conf is back the latest installment in 2022.
We are holding a half-day virtual event to discuss all topics about the [Fyne toolkit](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne), its community and the applications built around it.
The event is taking place on 14th october 2022 and this year will have a focus on best practices in platform-agnostic app development.

This event is a chance to learn more about Fyne and how it can be used to
easily build robust and performant cross platform applications.
We will showcase useful techniques, best practices, new features and existing applications from around the community.
Novice to expert - coder, tester or designer - we will have something for everyone.
