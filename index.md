## Fyne Conf 2020

Fyne Conf returns in 2020 to discuss all topics about the [Fyne toolkit](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne), its community and the applications built around it.
The event is taking place on 18th June 2020, starting at 1pm UTC.

This event is a chance to learn more about Fyne and how it can be used
to build robust and performant cross platform applications.
We will showcase useful features and techniques, existing applications and our desktop platform.
Novice to expert - coder, tester or designer - we will have something for everyone.
