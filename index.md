## Fyne Conf 2021

Fyne Conf is back for another installment in 2021.
We are planning a half-day virtual event to discuss all topics about the [Fyne toolkit](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne), its community and the applications built around it.
The event is taking place on 17th September 2021, time to be confirmed.

This event is a chance to learn more about Fyne and how it can be used to
easily build robust and performant cross platform applications.
We will showcase useful techniques, best practices, new features and existing applications from around the community.
Novice to expert - coder, tester or designer - we will have something for everyone.

## Location

Fyne Conf 2021 is an online meeting. It will be streamed live and recordings of
each session will be made available after the event.
