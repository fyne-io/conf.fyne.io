### Contributor planning

Before the main event we will use the space to have a discussion with project 
contributors and others who would like to help the future of Fyne.

We will direct the conversation based on attendees, but it will likely cover
technical topics, community management or how to get started as a contributor.

There is also a chance to use this time for coding or covering proposed additions to the toolkit.
