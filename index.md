## Fyne Conf 2020

Fyne Conf returns in 2020 to discuss all topics about the [Fyne toolkit](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne), its community and the applications built around it.
The event is planned for June 2020, a call for papers is [now open](https://www.papercall.io/fyneconf2020).

This event is a chance to learn more about Fyne and how it can be used
to build robust and performant cross platform applications.
We will showcase useful features and techniques, existing applications and our desktop platform.
Novice to expert - coder, tester or designer - we will have something for everyone.

## Location

Fyne Conf 2020 is an online meeting. The live streams will be publicly available to everyone
and they will be recorded for upload after the event.
