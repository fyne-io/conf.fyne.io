## For your apps and the future

This event will be a chance to learn more about Fyne and how it can be used
to build robust and performant cross platform applications.
There will also be segments on it's design and construction and how you could
contribute to future development.
Novice or expert, coder or designer we will have something for everyone.

## Location

The plan is to make the event an online meeting. Live streams and chat
rooms will allow anyone to attend from around the world.
