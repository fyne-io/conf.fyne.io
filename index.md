## Fyne Conf 2025

Fyne Conf 2025 is the latest opportunity to hear more about the Fyne toolkit and to meet some of the team.
This year it was held in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK and streamed online.

The event took place on 19th September 2025 in the University of Edinburgh [Bayes Centre](https://bayes-centre.ed.ac.uk) and was recorded for people who could not make it.

This event is a chance to learn more about Fyne and how it can be used to
easily build robust and performant cross platform applications.
We will showcase useful techniques, best practices, new features and existing applications from around the community.
Novice to expert - coder, tester or designer - there is something for everyone.
