## Fyne Conf 2019

We are in the process of planning the world's first conference focused on the [Fyne toolkit](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne).
Shortly a vote for topics and a call for contribtions will be added and a date set.
Please come back later to find more about the event and how to get tickets.

## Developers and Contributors

This event will be a chance to learn more about Fyne and how to use it as well as the background of how it is built and how you could contribute to future development.
Novice or expert, coder or designer we will have something for everyone.

## Location

The plan is to make the event an online meeting. Live streams and chat rooms will allow anyone to attend from around the world.
If there is a high level of interest we may also host a location or support local groups to gather and celebrate the event.
